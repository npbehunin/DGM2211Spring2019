1. Parent constrain lower arm joint together from IK, FK, and RK.
2. Add attribute to transform control, IKFK switch min to 0 max to 1.
3. (Press 3 to expand nodes in node editor.) IKFK switch connects to lamp arm FK 01 Jnt in all 3 parent constraints, then the REVERSE of the IKFK switch output goes to lamp arm IK 01 Jnt in the parent constraints (IK is 0, FK is 1!)

Other notes
Root jnt and base jnt should be in the same spot. The 3 systems (IK, FK, RK) should be parented under the base jnt

Root > Base > IK, FK, RK joint grps

There will be a transform, cog, AND a base control. Just add one for base.

FK, IK, and RK ctrl grps should be right under lamp base ctrl (transform > cog > base > FK, IK)

BIND THE SKIN TO THE RK JOINTS.
